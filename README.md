# Experience controller

Lacking of a good experience strategy is main difficult to our evaluation.
It is also cost time to learn new experience framework on market.
Therefore, we intend to design a minimum framework to measure our evaluation.
It is mostly based on our hasty design in Toulouse (our master intern project)
surrounding by four factors:

1. Tester: configure and execute test case from clean environment.
2. Monitor: access internal resource and report quantitative activities.
3. Env: recover test environment to clean state after each test.
4. IO: control flow of input and output events in single experience.

This project is not intended to compete to any competitor in marker
but only try to minimize our learning curve
while trying to improve the usage through time if necessary.
By philosophy, the universal and usability is forbidden
while friendly, simplicity and scalability are our ally.
